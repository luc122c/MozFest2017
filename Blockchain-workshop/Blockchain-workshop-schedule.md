# What is the aim?
The aim is for participants to learn about blockchain and about issues in research communication, and to crowdsource opportunities and limitations for blockchain in research communication.

We would like to learn:

- [ ] What are the key features of blockchain that people think are useful for research communication?
- [ ] Are these features possible to deliver through other means? What is the benefit of using blockchain?
- [ ] What are the limitations of blockchain in the research communication space?
- [ ] Are there blockchain developers who are interested in working on this problem for open science?

# Who is this for?
(Any of the following)

* Participants with an understanding of blockchain - to share what they know and learn about an application of blockchain for public good.
* Participants with an understanding of issues in research communication - to share what they know and their vision for redesigning the system, and to learn about blockchain technologies.
* **Participants who have experience in or are interested in gaining experience in developing blockchain applications for a real-world issue are strongly encouraged to attend** for learning and for networking with people leading projects in this space.
* Participants who enjoy facilitating and documenting - by drawing or by live blogging - and organising information on post-its and flipcharts are very welcome to come and practise their art in our session!

# Session outline

The session will run as an active workshop.

With up to 12 participants, we can run as a single group. With more than 12 participants, we will split into smaller groups for effective discussion.

## Schedule

### 0-5 minutes | Welcome participants

Encourage networking throughout the session, outline aims for output, invite people to contribute knowledge and/or documentation skills throughout.

* Ask participants about their experience and motivation (ask a few if a large group).
* Take a beginning temperature: raise hands if you think blockchain for research is an opportunity, a hype, or don’t know. **Note the result**

If we need to split into groups, we can use this introduction time to ask people to raise their hands if they have expertise in anything of the desired areas (blockchain, research communication, documentation, questioning/facilitation) and ensure the groups have a good mix of each.

### 5-20 minutes | The issues in research communication

Q: If we were to redesign research communication today, how would we do it? What would be key features and constraints?

* One participant presents 5-minute quick intro to issues in research communication to whole room or to their own group (depending on number of keen participants; Naomi is happy to deliver this, but welcomes other speakers)
* Groups spend 10 minutes designing an ideal research communication system for the future. Outcome: post-its with key features and key constraints.

- [ ] Roleplay cards are supplied to assist groups to do this: the ‘facilitator’ keeps the conversation focussed (i.e. we care about a constructive vision, not an opportunity to air grievances) and ensures everyone has a chance to participate; the ‘documenter’ ensures that key features and constraints are documented on individual post-its; the ‘timekeeper’ keeps a check on the time and reports when 5, 8 and 10 minutes are up.

### 20-35 minutes | Blockchain

Q: What are the key features and constraints of blockchain?

* One participant presents 5-minute quick intro to blockchain technologies to the whole room or to their own group (depending on number of keen participants; ____ I need one+ willing volunteer for this)
* Groups spend 10 minutes discussing the key features and constraints of blockchain. Outcome: post-its with key features and key constraints of blockchain technologies.

- [ ] Roleplay cards are supplied to assist groups to do this: the ‘facilitator’ keeps the conversation focussed (i.e. we care most about features/constraints of relevance to research communication) and ensures everyone has a chance to participate; the ‘documenter’ ensures that key features and constraints are documented on individual post-its; the ‘timekeeper’ keeps a check on the time and reports when 5, 8 and 10 minutes are up.

### 35-40 minutes | Mapping exercise

To match up features and constraints of blockchain and "ideal research communication" i.e. grouping post-its, voting on what people think is feasible.

* Collect post-its for features and constraints into a central space.
* Ask participants to arrange post-its to show where features (blockchain) and issues (research communication) match or not and where constraints conflict with features.

### 40-50 minutes | Group discussion to assess the situation - are there opportunities? What are the constraints / limitations / blockers?

- [ ] Key Qs to ask?
- [ ] How to document this?

### 50-55 minutes | Synthesise and conclude

* Invite final comments, proposals, pushback.
* Vote: hype, opportunity, or don’t know

###  55-60 minutes | Reflection time

* Invite participants to share what they have learnt today and/or their hopes and expectations for future of research communication and/or blockchain
* Encourage participants to network and share contacts before they leave.
