# Open science at MozFest2017

The full schedule is on [Guidebook](https://guidebook.com/guide/114124/)

There's so many amazing things going on at MozFest! :tada: But how can we do it all?

If you've got FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), never fear. Because there's also an incredible :sparkles: crowd of likeminded folk coming to MozFest too.

So let's make sure someone is at everything, and it would be great to compile resources/notes/outputs so we can all keep track.

We can be like this:
